This folder mainly exists since this process might not actually be sql but some selfmade pseudo language.
But even if it won't be i think having templates of what has to be added generally will make our live easier.

Every template should follow certain rules:
	- A template may have mu
	- Having clear variables that have to be replaced
		- These variables are encased in $ as to be easily distinguished
		- The variable names are camelcase and don't contain any special characters
		- Two variables with the same name will always have the same end value
		- This allows you to match them with $\ew+$
